                <hr>
                <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
                    where
                    they had earlier evolved.[30][31][32] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to
                    about 30,000 years ago.[33] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in
                    Nepal
                    dates to around the same time.[34]

                    After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
                    structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                    Balochistan.[35] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley civilisation,[36][35] the first
                    urban
                    culture in South Asia.[37] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have
                    been
                    discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[38] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and
                    adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley civilisation. It is possible that
                    the
                    Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent
                    (around
                    6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and
                    Indo-Aryans from across the border.[39] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had reached Nepal
                    either
                    directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or both.[40] Stella
                    Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in Nepal
                    even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of
                    Kathmandu.[41]</p>


                <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
                <p>Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi)
                    wide, with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and
                    longitudes
                    80° and 89°E. Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian
                    plate,
                    then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor
                    spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[77] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn
                    oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian plate.[77] These dual
                    processes,
                    driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian
                    continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[77] The rising
                    barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as
                    100,000
                    years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the western
                    region, rivers which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges.[78]
                    Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly
                    filled
                    with river-borne sediment[79] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[80] Nepal lies almost
                    completely within this collision zone, occupying the central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly
                    one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas,[81][82][83][84][85][86] with a small strip of
                    southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the northwest
                    stretching
                    up to the Tibetan plateau.[78]</p>
